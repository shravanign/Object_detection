# Real_time_object_detection
It allows real time object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once). YOLO is a network used to detect objects. It is a single network
similar to CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that takes an image frame as an input and outputs a vector of bounding boxes and class 
predictions. Once you start running the code, the camera starts running and image frames are extracted from the on-going video. We can also
train YOLO using different data sets for object identification.

Download the pre-trained YOLO v3 weights file from the link ( https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights ) and place it in the current directory or you can directly download to the current directory in terminal using

$ wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
